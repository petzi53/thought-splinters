summary: How to insert into an R Markdown document a special emoji without knowing
  the name or keyword? I encountered this problem in conjunction with some pull requests
  for the  OpenIntro textbook Introduction to Modern Statistics. Already I reported
  on in a [previous blog entry](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/2021/04/19/using-emojis-in-r-and-rmarkdown/),
  but for this problem, I had to revisit this issue. for [interactive tutorials](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials)
  for my experience with my first encounter with the [emo package](https://github.com/hadley/emo).

<p>I already <a href="https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/2021/04/19/using-emojis-in-r-and-rmarkdown/">reported on my learnings</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/emo">emo package</a> in conjunction with some pull requests for <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials">interactive tutorials</a> for the OpenIntro textbook <a href="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/index.html">Introduction to Modern Statistics</a>. In the meanwhile, the book is â€” after some reorganization of its chapters â€” finished and published. I ordered the <a href="https://smile.amazon.de/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/">print version of the book via Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>On August 13th, I started working through the tutorials and reading the new book and <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apetzi53+">prepared several pull requests</a>. There I encountered the problem of finding a special emoji without knowing the name or keyword. Meanwhile, I solved the difficulty of finding the emoji name for ðŸ”Ÿ. There are even several solutions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel" title="GitHub account of Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel">Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel</a> referenced the <a href="emojiterra.com">EmojiTerra.com</a> website to me. There you can search for the symbol to get <a href="https://emojiterra.com/keycap-10/" title="Emoji Keycap-10 page on EmojiTerra">all the details of the corresponding emoji</a>.</li>
<li>With <code>emo::ji_name</code>, you will get a list of 4239 names as character strings and their corresponding value as emoji. But you have to inspect the list manually, which really is not practical. (At least I did not find a better solution programmatically.)</li>
<li>A more practical solution is to produce a data frame with <code>emojis_df &lt;- emo::jis</code> and to inspect it via the RStudio command <code>View(emojis_df)</code>. There you can put the emoji symbol into the search field to get the required information.</li>
<li>You could also get the Unicode on macOS via the window for emojis and symbols (CMD-SHIFT-SPACE) with a right-click on the icon. You will get a bunch of localized information, including the Unicode.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>All in all, just options 1 and 3 are feasible in a practical manner. Either to call the <a href="emojiterra.com">EmojiTerra.com</a> website or to use <code>View(emo::jis)</code> inside RStudio.</p>
