summary: How to insert into an R Markdown document a special emoji without knowing
  the name or keyword? I encountered this problem in conjunction with some pull requests
  for the  OpenIntro textbook Introduction to Modern Statistics. Already I reported
  on in a [previous blog entry](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/2021/04/19/using-emojis-in-r-and-rmarkdown/),
  but for this problem, I had to revisit this issue. for [interactive tutorials](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials)
  for my experience with my first encounter with the [emo package](https://github.com/hadley/emo).

I already [reported on my learnings](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/2021/04/19/using-emojis-in-r-and-rmarkdown/) on the [emo package](https://github.com/hadley/emo) in conjunction with some pull requests for [interactive tutorials](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials) for the OpenIntro textbook [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/index.html). In the meanwhile, the book is --- after some reorganization of its chapters --- finished and published. I ordered the [print version of the book via Amazon](https://smile.amazon.de/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/).

On August 13th, I started working through the tutorials and reading the new book and [prepared several pull requests](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims-tutorials/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apetzi53+). There I encountered the problem of finding a special emoji without knowing the name or keyword. Meanwhile, I solved the difficulty of finding the emoji name for `r emo::ji("keycap_ten")`. There are even several solutions.

1.  [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel "GitHub account of Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel") referenced the [EmojiTerra.com](emojiterra.com) website to me. There you can search for the symbol to get [all the details of the corresponding emoji](https://emojiterra.com/keycap-10/ "Emoji Keycap-10 page on EmojiTerra").
2.  With `emo::ji_name`, you will get a list of 4239 names as character strings and their corresponding value as emoji. But you have to inspect the list manually, which really is not practical. (At least I did not find a better solution programmatically.)
3.  A more practical solution is to produce a data frame with `emojis_df <- emo::jis` and to inspect it via the RStudio command `View(emojis_df)`. There you can put the emoji symbol into the search field to get the required information.
4.  You could also get the Unicode on macOS via the window for emojis and symbols (CMD-SHIFT-SPACE) with a right-click on the icon. You will get a bunch of localized information, including the Unicode.

```

## Summary

All in all, just options 1 and 3 are feasible in a practical manner. Either to call the [EmojiTerra.com](emojiterra.com) website or to use `View(emo::jis)` inside RStudio.
